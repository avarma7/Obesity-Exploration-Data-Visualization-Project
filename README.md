# Stat 451 Final Project

# Question:
How do obesity rates differ globally between countries and regionally within the United States? 
Many claim that physical activity and diet may be related to obesity. So, do factors such as the amount of physical activity and vegetable consumption have an association with obesity rates globally and within the United States? Are these trends, if any, globally and regionally within the United States, consistent with each other?

# Visualization Analysis
Global Obesity Rates by Country 2023: 

The aim of this visualization is not to quantify the obesity rates by country but to easily show the general trend of obesity rates globally through color hue and explore any patterns. Darker shades (blue) reflect high obesity rates and lighter shades (light green) reflect low obesity rates. From the map, it is easy to see that obesity rates tend to be higher in the Americas, especially the United States, the Middle East, and Oceania. We can also see that obesity rates tend to be lower in many Asian countries such as India and China, and central African countries such as Sudan. Now that we know the general pattern of how obesity rates differ between countries, we can look at factors such as physical activity and diet between these countries and compare them to this map to see if they reflect any similar/opposite pattern to the obesity rates, indicating a possible association.


United States Obesity Rates by State 2021:

Similar to the previous visual, the goal of this visual is to easily show the general trend of obesity rates within the United States through color hue and explore any patterns. Darker shades (blue) reflect high obesity rates and lighter shades (light green) reflect low obesity rates. From the map, we can see that states located on the west and east coasts such as California and New York tend to have lower obesity rates. We can also see that obesity rates tend to be higher in states in the Midwest like South Dakota and Oklahoma and in some states in the South such as Mississippi and Alabama, which have the highest rates. Again, now that we know the general pattern of obesity rates across the states, we can look at factors such as physical activity and diet across the states and compare them to this map to see if they reflect any similar/opposite pattern to the obesity rates, indicating a possible association.


Vegetable Consumption vs. Obesity Rate per Country:

To explore if there is an association between the obesity rate and vegetable consumption globally, I have plotted each country's average per capita vegetable consumption per person per year in 2020 against its obesity rate in 2023 which was shown in the first visual. Although the vegetable consumption metric is from 2020, it has not changed much in the past three years so we would expect to see similar results with little variation in the data if we were to use 2023 data. I decided to use a scatter plot so the viewer can easily notice any patterns or correlations between the two variables, for example, if the data follows a line or some other well-known function. Inherently, we would expect to see that as the obesity rate increases vegetable consumption decreases, but from the plot we can see that this is not the case. From this scatter plot, although the country with a low obesity rate has the highest vegetable consumption and the country with the highest obesity rate has a low vegetable consumption, there appears to be no distinct pattern among the data. The points are highly scattered and varied especially between countries that have an obesity rate between 10 and 30 percent. This indicates that there may not be an association between obesity rate and vegetable consumption on a global scale.
